# Exercise 34 is about accessing elements of lists.

# Lists start at 0, which is kind of confusing.
# The reason this is, is that math is easier starting at 0.

# So say we have the following list..

animals = ['bear', 'python3.6', 'peacock', 'kangaroo', 'whale', 'platypus']

# If I said tell me the animal at 2, you would say the 3rd one, you have to add 1 since the list starts at 0.

# If I said tell me the 2nd animal, you would say the animal that is at 1, subtract one.

# In exercise 34, we have to do 8 problems similar to the one above.
