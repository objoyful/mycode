# Exercise 27 was about memorizing logic.
# Boolean logic is using different terms to get a result, True or False

# Terms:

# and - Both terms have to be True for the expression to be true Ex: True and False is False, True and True is True 
# or - One of the terms have to be True EX: True or False is True, False or False is False
# not - the inverse EX: not (True) is False , not (False) is True
# != (not equal) - if the two expressions are not equal this is True EX: 1 != 0 is True, "test" != "test" is False
# == (equal) - if the two expressions are equla, this is True. EX: 1 == 0 is False, "test" == "test" is True 
# > - Greater than EX: 1 > 0 is True, 0 > 1 is False
# >= - Greater than or equal EX: 1 >= 0 is True, 0 >= 1 is False
# < - Less than EX: 1 < 0 is False, 0 < 1 is True
# <= - Less than or equal to EX: 1 <= 0 is False, 0 <= 1 is True

# The result will always be True or False
